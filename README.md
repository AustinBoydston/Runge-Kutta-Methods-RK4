# Runge Kutta RK4
This is a program that calculates Runge Kutta Method RK4.

## What I learned
* How to implement complicated multi-step math concepts in a program.
* Encapsulation of details within functions to solve problems in a modular manner

## Running the program
Make sure python is installed on your machine then run the following to install matplotlib
```Bash
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```
Now run the program with 
```Bash
python Runge_Kutta_Taylor_Series.py
```
